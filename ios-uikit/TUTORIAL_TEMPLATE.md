# MapTiler Tutorial for iOS UIKIt/Swift

This tutorial describes how to create a simple iOS application using Swift and UIKit.

> This tutorial was written for macOS

## Create new project

Open Xcode and create new project. Choose iOS -> App template. In the "Choose options for your new project" select Interface to "Storyboard", lifecycle to "UI App Delegate", language to "Swift"

## Add MapBox Native SDK for iOS

Add mapBox SDK to your project using CocoaPods.

1. If you don't have CocoaPods installed, run `sudo gem install cocoapods`
1. Open a terminal window, and `cd` into your project directory.
1. Create a Podfile by running `pod init`.
1. Add MapBox dependencies to your Podfile. The file should look as follows:

    ```ruby
        # Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
        platform :ios, '9.0'

        target 'SimpleMap_UIKit' do
        use_frameworks!

        # mapBox dependencies
        pod 'Mapbox-iOS-SDK', '6.2.1'	

        end
    ```

1. Run `pod install` to download and integrate dependencies.
1. The previous command will generate workspace file. Use it from now on. (`SimpleMap_UIKit.xcworkspace`).

## MapTiler Key

1. Create [MapTiler cloud](https://www.maptiler.com/cloud/) account.
1. [Obtain the api key](https://cloud.maptiler.com/account/keys).
1. Set the MapTilerKey property in `SimpleMap_UIKit/info.plist` to the value obtained in the previous step.
1. Open the `SimpleMap_UIKit.xcworkspace` in Xcode and navigate to ViewController.swift. Add code to read MapTilerKey from property list.

```swift
snippet(ViewController.swift#GetKey)
```

## Initialize Map View

1. Open the `ViewController.swift` file.
1. Add the following code in the `viewDidLoad` method in order to construct map view.

```swift
snippet(ViewController.swift#MapInit)
```

> If you would need to respond to MapView events, for example perform an action after MapView initialization finished, place the `MGLMapViewDelegate` protocol name after the `ViewController` name and set the MapView delegate reference to ViewController,

>     ```swift
>         class ViewController: UIViewController, MGLMapViewDelegate { 
>             ...
>         }
>     ```
> 
>     and 
> 
>     ```swift
>         override func viewDidLoad() {
>             ...
>             mapView.delegate = self
>             ...
>         }
>     ```
